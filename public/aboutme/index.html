              &nbsp;&nbsp; Hi! I'm Jade, a self taught developer with a focus in web development. I did most of my studying through courses on Udemy, of which I
              have completed four. I moved to Utah just a few months ago and I'm currently looking for work. I'm proficient in front-end and back-end web
              development, but primarily back-end. I am very passionate about programming, I'm especially interested in doing more game development, or anything
              that involves problem solving or use of algorithms. I still have much to learn, but I think my passion for learning is my best quality, and I'm
              especially passionate about learning to be an excellent programmer. I intend on doing my best to build my portfolio and network within the tech
              industry in Utah, with intent to get admitted into Harbour.Space University in Barcelona soon in order to hone my skills.
            </p>
